# WebApp_UnderTheHood

This repository contains a sample ASP.NET Core web application demonstrating authentication and authorization mechanisms under the hood.

## Overview

The application showcases how to implement authentication and authorization features using ASP.NET Core, specifically focusing on the use of cookies for authentication and policy-based authorization.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Utilizes ASP.NET Core's Cookie Authentication middleware to authenticate users.
- **Authorization**: Implements policy-based authorization to restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user claims.
- **Custom Authorization Requirement**: Demonstrates how to define and use custom authorization requirements (`HRManagerProbationRequirement`) along with custom handlers.

## Setup

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WebApp_UnderTheHood.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the cloned repository.

   ```
   cd WebApp_UnderTheHood
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Application**: Build and run the application using the .NET CLI.

   ```
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Access the Application**: Once the application is running, access it through your web browser at `https://localhost:5001`.

## Configuration

- **Authentication Configuration**: Authentication is configured using the `AddAuthentication()` method in `Startup.cs`. The application uses Cookie Authentication with a custom cookie name (`MyCookieAuth`) and specifies the login path and expiration time for the cookie.
- **Authorization Configuration**: Authorization policies are defined using the `AddAuthorization()` method in `Startup.cs`. Policies such as "AdminOnly", "mustBelongToDepartment", and "HRManagerOnly" are added, each with specific requirements based on user claims.
- **Custom Authorization Requirement**: The application defines a custom authorization requirement `HRManagerProbationRequirement` and its corresponding handler `HRManagerProbationRequirementHandler`. This requirement checks if a user in the HR department is also a manager and has been in the role for a specified probation period.

## Usage

- **Authentication**: Users can authenticate themselves by accessing the login page at `/Account/login`.
- **Authorization**: Access to different parts of the application is restricted based on user claims. For example, only users with the "admin" claim can access areas protected by the "AdminOnly" policy.
